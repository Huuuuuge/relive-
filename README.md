# relive-
A VR app to treat and assess addiction.


INSPIRATION :

A virtual reality (VR) app that helps patients to cure addiction could be designed to simulate real-life scenarios that trigger cravings for the addictive substance or behavior. The app could provide patients with a safe and controlled environment to practice and develop coping strategies to deal with these triggers.

KEY FEATURE :

1) Modules to Practise along with the doctor in controlled environment
2) Modules to practise once the patient is discharged 
3) Reward based games for the patient
4) Emmersive environments for meditation and yoga

HOW WE BUILT IT :

We built it with ❤️ and some C# in Unity. Initially, our motive was to target only phobias, but with the help of mentors and all the brainstorming, we were able to include all these features into our app. Also, we used the Gvr event system and Gvr Editor Emulator for the Virtual reality part.


THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES :

This project aims to address the issue of relapse in patients who have undergone rehabilitation for addiction. Despite undergoing therapy, patients may still be at risk of relapse due to external triggers and temptations. By using virtual reality technology, this project allows patients and doctors to simulate real-life scenarios that may trigger a relapse, giving patients the opportunity to learn how to resist these temptations in a controlled environment. Additionally, the gamified module provides patients with a fun and interactive way to practice avoiding relapse, while the custom VR environments for yoga provide a way to maintain mental peace and promote healthy habits. Overall, this project seeks to support patients in their recovery journey and reduce the risk of relapse, ultimately improving their long-term outcomes.


PROBLEMS WE RAN INTO : 

1. Limited availability of VR headsets: We found that not all patients had access to VR headsets, which hindered their ability to participate in the program. To address this, we explored using more affordable VR headsets, such as Google Cardboard and looked into alternative methods of delivering the program.

2. Lack of ground research: As we did not conduct ground research, we faced challenges in understanding the true nature and extent of the problem we were trying to solve. To address this, we reached out to rehab centers and addiction specialists to gain a better understanding of the needs and challenges of patients during their recovery journey.

3. Creating effective VR environments: Developing effective and engaging VR environments for patients and doctors was challenging. To overcome this, we consulted with VR experts, therapists, and patients to create tailored environments that would provide a realistic and immersive experience.

4. Ensuring patient engagement: Patient engagement was a key challenge, particularly with the gamified module. To overcome this, we worked on creating a more engaging and interactive experience, incorporating feedback from patients and doctors throughout the development process.

WHATS NEXT FOR relive' :

1) Automation in Environment generation
2) Sending relapse data to doctor in real time 
3) Expansion to new platforms such as hololens, oculus, AR
